Little-known products are bought too rarely and remain little known. This paper studies how policies aimed at mitigating the cold-start problem, specifically by low- ering prices for new products, affect welfare and how much of the welfare effect is due to a change in the speed of social learning. Based on data from Airbnbs located in Manhattan, we estimate a structural model with short-lived consumers and long-lived hosts who make dynamic entry, exit, and pricing decisions. We then simulate a counterfactual reduction in Airbnb’s revenue fee for new listings. While this increases total welfare, we find that it does not accelerate social learning. By contrast, if the cost of the fee reduction is passed on to hosts, faster social learning in itself increases consumer welfare by up to 5% and is the main driver of the total welfare gain.","tags":["platforms","product reviews","information externalities","market dynamics","social learning"],"title":"The Cost of the Cold-Start Problem on Airbnb","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Ederer","Tim Simcoe","Regina Seibel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1748736000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748736000,"objectID":"e58cc27410233bc4547e391be520f883","permalink":"/publication/digkiller/","publishdate":"2025-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/digkiller/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines the effects of over 1,000 acquisitions by major technology firms on innovation. Using detailed patent and workforce data linked to technology acquisitions and a suite of event-study and difference-in differences designs, we document four main findings. First, although most acquired startups hold no patents, those with patents tend to operate in technology areas where the acquirer already has a presence and which subsequently experience further acquisition activity. Second, innovation typically rises before an acquisition but only persists afterward when follow-on acquisitions occur, suggesting that acquisitions reinforce rather than reverse innovation trends. Third, at the patent level, acquired patents receive significantly more citations after the acquisition than comparable patents, and these effects are not driven solely by self-citations from the acquiring firm. These post-acquisition citation effects are smaller when more employees from the acquired firm are retained, consistent with innovation spillovers occurring through employee mobility. Fourth, we document significant workforce attrition exceeding 60% on average at target firms three years post-acquisition. Our results suggest that acquisitions by digital incumbents often amplify, rather than suppress, the diffusion and visibility of acquired technologies.","tags":["innovation","acquisitions","patents"],"title":"Digital (Killer?)

We show that prohibiting acquisitions has a weakly negative innovation effect. We provide conditions determining the size of the effect and, in particular, whether it is zero or positive. We further analyze the effects of less restrictive policies, including merger remedies and the tax treatment of acquisitions and initial public offerings. Such interventions tend to prevent acquisitions only if the entrant has sufficiently high stand-alone profits.","tags":["innovation","killer acquisitions","merger policy","potential competition","start-ups"],"title":"Killer Acquisitions and Beyond: Policy Effects on Innovation Strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Regina Seibel","Samuel Skoda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"6c6315f8b4b324e1ef87fa28924ee46c","permalink":"/publication/collusion/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/collusion/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies bid rigging in auctions with bidder preselection. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the optimal behavior of a partial bid-rigging cartel and show how commonly used two-stage auction formats, in which the first stage is used to preselect bidders, may be exploited. Bidder preselection based on opening bids allows cartels to exclude competitive rivals and thereby increase procurement costs above what would be possible without preselection. To test our predictions, we use administrative data from public procurement in Slovakia. We develop a collusion marker reflecting the optimal cartel strategy and identify bidders suspected of collusion. After a selective auction procedure was abandoned, these collusive bidders adjusted their strategy and the savings gap between auctions with and without collusion decreased.","tags":["collusion","bid-rigging","public procurement","auctions"],"title":"Collusion by Exclusion in Public Procurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Fahn","Regina Seibel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"fb007e9069706d2d1df7a77ddea0e517","permalink":"/publication/ojs/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ojs/","section":"publication","summary":".","tags":["present bias","on-the-job-search","commitment"],"title":"Present Bias in the Labor Market - When it Pays to be Naive","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory Crawford","Matteo Courthoud","Regina Seibel","Simon Zuzek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659312000,"objectID":"81525cb225e9ea0f68201c9b436af9ff","permalink":"/publication/amazon_entry/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amazon_entry/","section":"publication","summary":"We want to find out whether the concern of seller and consumer harm as a result of Amazon entry finds emprical support beyond anecdotal evidence provided by the media.
