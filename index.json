While consumers benefit from observing reviews written by others, they do not account for the benefits of trying new products, thereby revealing the products’ quality to everyone else, in their own purchase decision. In this paper, we investigate the inefficiency arising from such insufficient social learning on Airbnb. We estimate a dynamic structural model of demand and supply for Airbnbs in Manhattan, New York, from 2016 to 2019. We then implement counterfactual tax-subsidy regimes, which boost demand for new listings relative to incumbent listings and address the cold-start problem. In our main counterfactual, we find that, on average, the rental rate of unreviewed listings should be 30% lower, leading to 25% higher demand. According to our estimates, the cold-start problem reduces social welfare by $177,241 per month, a harm that is entirely driven by a reduction in consumer surplus.","tags":["platforms","product reviews","information externalities","market dynamics","social learning"],"title":"The Cost of the Cold-Start Problem on Airbnb","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Igor Letina","Armin Schmutzler","Regina Seibel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711929600,"objectID":"702b9231bece250f4dbf558eff71eb31","permalink":"/publication/killer_acquisitions/","publishdate":"2024-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/killer_acquisitions/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper provides a theory of strategic innovation project choice by incumbents and start-ups which serves as a foundation for the analysis of acquisition policy. We show that prohibiting acquisitions has a weakly negative innovation effect. We provide conditions determining the size of the effect and, in particular, whether it is zero or positive. We further analyze the effects of less restrictive policies, including merger remedies and the tax treatment of acquisitions and initial public offerings. Such interventions tend to prevent acquisitions only if the entrant has sufficiently high stand-alone profits.","tags":["innovation","killer acquisitions","merger policy","potential competition","start-ups"],"title":"Killer Acquisitions and Beyond: Policy Effects on Innovation Strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Ederer","Weicheng Min","Regina Seibel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711929600,"objectID":"a7063155ae28a0695331e3ef7e570c56","permalink":"/publication/common_ownership/","publishdate":"2024-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/common_ownership/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["common ownership","innovation"],"title":"Mechanisms of Common Ownership","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Regina Seibel","Samuel Skoda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"6c6315f8b4b324e1ef87fa28924ee46c","permalink":"/publication/collusion/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/collusion/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies bid rigging in auctions with bidder preselection. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the optimal behavior of a partial bid-rigging cartel and show how commonly used two-stage auction formats, in which the first stage is used to preselect bidders, may be exploited. Bidder preselection based on opening bids allows cartels to exclude competitive rivals and thereby increase procurement costs above what would be possible without preselection. To test our predictions, we use administrative data from public procurement in Slovakia. We develop a collusion marker reflecting the optimal cartel strategy and identify bidders suspected of collusion. After a selective auction procedure was abandoned, these collusive bidders adjusted their strategy and the savings gap between auctions with and without collusion decreased.","tags":["collusion","bid-rigging","public procurement","auctions"],"title":"Collusion by Exclusion in Public Procurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Fahn","Regina Seibel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"fb007e9069706d2d1df7a77ddea0e517","permalink":"/publication/ojs/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ojs/","section":"publication","summary":".","tags":["present bias","on-the-job-search","commitment"],"title":"Present Bias in the Labor Market - When it Pays to be Naive","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory Crawford","Matteo Courthoud","Regina Seibel","Simon Zuzek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659312000,"objectID":"81525cb225e9ea0f68201c9b436af9ff","permalink":"/publication/amazon_entry/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amazon_entry/","section":"publication","summary":"We want to find out whether the concern of seller and consumer harm as a result of Amazon entry finds emprical support beyond anecdotal evidence provided by the media.
